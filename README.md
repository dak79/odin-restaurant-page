## Description

This project is part of [The Odin Project - Full Stack JavaScript Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page). The main goals are configuring Webpack, using Npm and a code design with ES6 Modules.
As content the page is around a Soup Restaurant which does not exist.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Npm
- Webpack

## Assignment

- Run npm init in your project directory to generate a package.json file.

- Run npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev to install webpack to the node_modules directory of your project.

- Create a src and dist directory with the following contents:

  - an index.js file in src;
  - an index.html file in dist.

- Create a webpack.config.js file that looks just like our file from the tutorial.

- Set up an HTML skeleton inside of dist/index.html with single `<div id="content">`.

- Create a bare-bones homepage for a restaurant. Include an image, headline, and some copy about how wonderful the restaurant is. It’s okay to hard-code these into the HTML for now just to see how they look on the page.

- Now remove those elements from the HTML (so leave only the `<html>`, `<body>`, and `<div id="content">` tags) and instead create them by using JavaScript only

- Next, set up your restaurant site to use tabbed browsing to access the Contact and Menu pages.

- Put the contents of each ‘tab’ inside of its own module.

- Write the tab-switching logic inside of index.js. You should have event listeners for each tab that wipes out the current contents and then runs the correct ‘tab module’ to populate it again.
